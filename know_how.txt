Creating dev environment:
Download hadoop
Download java if you dont have
find java libraries at user/local
find java binaries  by which javac
get openssh-server
create a dedicated hadoop user
-> sudo addgroup
-> sudo adduser --ingroup:

change into hadoop user

run ssh-keygen -t rsa -P "" for empty password
check ssh localhost

untar hadoop

-> append hadoop user ./.bashrc
 JAVA_HOME=java lib folder and  HADOOP_HOME= hadoop installation folder
 and add java binaries to path

 set java home in hadoop-env.sh in etc

 change core-site hdfs-site mapred-site accordingly
 can get changes from google

 hadoop namenode -format to format new dfs
 then start-all.sh

 web interface is on localhost:50070


Starting a new project:

Create gitrep
Intellij -> file-> new -> from rep
-> create a folder in your project and copy all jar file inside hadoop/share
-> then add them as library
-> add them to dependencies  in modules->dependencies tab
-> set an output path in modules->paths tab
-> update .gitignore
-> in your edit conf dont forget to say use classpath of module

You may now compile and run locally dont forget to change your input output in edit conf

Creating a jar file:

Add project structure->artifact add artifacts with dependencies using current module and current main
-> then select second option and select a manifest file
-> under build go build artifacts

Running on cluster:
